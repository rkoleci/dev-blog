NeoVim has it's own clipboard memory so coping from it and pasting to another system might not always work as you expect it.

## How to Copy from NeoVim editor ?

1. Open file with command `nvim students.txt`
2. Press `Esc`
3. Press `v`
4. Use keys `h, j, k, l` to select text
5. Press `"*y` to yank (copy) selected text

## Fast way

First setup your nvim editor like this:

1. Navigate and open ~/.config/nvim/init.vim
2. Add below code

```
let mapleader=","

vnoremap  <leader>y  "*y
```

3. Save and close file
4. Restart terminal

## How to setup Clipboard for Neovim ?

If you want to use the same clipboard for system and nvim, you can do it like this:

### Mac

Run this in terminal:

```
set clipboard+=unnamedplus
```

### Windows

Download clipboard [here](https://github.com/equalsraf/win32yank).
Run this command:

```
set clipboard+=unnamedplus
```

### Linux

Run this two commands:

```
sudo apt install wl-clipboard
```

```
set clipboard+=unnamedplus
```

Now you should be able to use the system clipboard inside neovim as well.
