# How to convert markdown files to PDF in VS Code ?

All you need is to install an extension and use it inside VSCode.

<TOCInline toc={props.toc} asDisclosure />

Markdown is an easy to write language to create blogposts, emails, templates, notes etc. It consists of a few basic rules and that's about it.

Personally, I'm using markup to write this blogpost.

MarkdownLint is the best extension to use for converting markup into pdf, html or images. It's free and easy to use.

It's handy when you want to share a document with someone or save it for later.

### 1. Install extension MarkdownLink

Open VS Code exensions from the sidebar or `Cmd+Shift+X` or `Cmd+P` and type in `>ext`.

Or simply visit the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint">website</a> and click install:

### 2. Open your markdownfile

Or create a new file with extension (.md).

Example: CityTour.md

### 3. Convert to PDF

`Cmd+P` and write `>Markdown PDF` or other file formats: jpg, png or html.

Process is the same.

File will be downloaded next to your original file.

# Tips

### Open Preview

`Cmd+P` write `>MarkdownPDF Open Preview` to see the result live

Or right click on the filename at the top and hit Open Preview.

### Side by Side

After open preview - to the left hit this icon to split the view into two.

### Responsive layouts

Export to HTML for responsive long markdowns instead of jpeg, png

### `formatOnSave`

Enable `formatOnSave` in VSCode settings to auto format the markdown

### Ubuntu bug

Ubuntu users have reported bugs with this extension. A better solution to that is <a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandadoc</a> or Grip
